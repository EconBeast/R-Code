# R-Code
I expect to take computational stats next semester, where R is the preferred programming language. I'll start working on adding to this repository in February-June. Nevertheless, I had one semester of R, so familiar enough to run basic data work. For the current projects I work on, I solely use it for ggplot
To add: 1) ggplot files
